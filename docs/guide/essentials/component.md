# Components

Components allow us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

## Kinds of Components

There are three kinds of components in Refina:

- **Output component**: Components only do some output. e.g. `h1`, `p`...
- **Trigger component**: Components with a event to fire. e.g. `button`, `input`...
- **Status component**: Components with a state. e.g. `checkbox`, `radio`...

:::info
The above three kinds of components are the most common use cases.

The low-level implementation of components is just a context function. So it is possible to create a kind of component that is not listed above.

## Use a Component

A component is always registered as a context function.

For most of the applications, you can just use the components provided by existing plugins.
