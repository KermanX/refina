# Why Refina

## The Problems

For most of today's web applications, what a page should be like and do what, in fact, can be described in a few words. But to implement it using the traditional frontend frameworks, you always need to write hundreds of lines of code.

It's true that traditional frontend frameworks, such as Vue with Vuetify, can produce well-detailed, great-looking applications. But the fact is that even some large companies cannot create perfect web pages for reasons of development efficiency. Those who can take advantage of the features of traditional frontend frameworks are few. And even they have the ability to do so, they may still have no time to use them to create a perfect web page.

We need a frontend framework that **give first priority to development efficiency**, then to the completeness, then the runtime performance.

## The Solutions

- **ImGUI-like state management**

  Free from the burden of state management, just write your code.

- **No need to write any end tags**

  End tags are very annoying, and they are not necessary in most cases.

- **Use positional parameters instead of named parameters**

  You needn't to write the name of the parameter, which saves a lot of time.

- **Return value as the event handler**

  Check the return value of the component function to handle events, so you don't need to write another function.

- **Plain TypeScript**

  No DSL like JSX or Vue SFC. So you can use the same syntax in both renderings and logic.

## The Result

Refina is still in the early stage of development, but it has already shown its advantages in development efficiency.

Based on the real projects, the **line of code reduced to about `60%~70%`**, and **the development efficiency is `1.4x~1.6x`** of traditional frameworks.
