# Why Refina

## The Problems

For most of today's web applications, what a page should be like and do what, in fact, can be described in a few words. But to implement it using the traditional frontend frameworks, you always need to write hundreds of lines of code.

Traditional frontend frameworks, such as Vue with Vuetify, may generate well-detailed, visually appealing apps. However, even major corporations cannot always produce flawless web apps due to development efficiency. That is, even if people have the talent, they may lack the time to develop a perfect web page, while the majority of folks lack proficiency in traditional frontend frameworks. As a result, some capabilities of standard frontend frameworks go mostly unutilized.

We need a frontend framework that **gives first priority to development efficiency**, then to completeness, then to runtime performance.

## The Solutions

- **ImGUI-like state management**

  Free from the burden of state management, just write your code. Like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), but with much less code and no complex compiler.

- **No need to write any end tags**

  End tags are very annoying, and they are not necessary in most cases.

- **Use positional parameters instead of named parameters**

  You needn't write the name of the parameter, which saves a lot of time.

- **Return value as the event handler**

  Check the return value of the component function to handle events, so you don't need to write another function.

- **Plain TypeScript**

  No DSL like JSX or Vue SFC. So you can use the same syntax in both renderings and logic.

## The Result

Refina is still in the early stage of development, but it has already shown its advantages in development efficiency.

Based on the real projects, the **line of code is reduced to about `60%~70%`**, and **the development efficiency is `1.4x~1.6x`** of traditional frameworks.
